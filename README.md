# Embedded-Project
A wearable speedometer which calculated velocity by measuring angular velocities available from a gyroscope â€“ without a GPS. Strategically placing the sensor and microcontroller on the legs or feet can capture the angular velocities, those angular velocities are converted to linear velocities and calculated distance traveled.
