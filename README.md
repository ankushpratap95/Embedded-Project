# Embedded-Project
A wearable speedometer which calculats velocity by measuring angular velocities available from a gyroscope â€“ without a GPS. 
After strategically placing the sensor and microcontroller on the legs or feet, we capture the angular velocities, those angular velocities are then converted to linear velocities and ultimately calculated the distance traveled.
